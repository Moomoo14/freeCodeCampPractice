          <hr>
          <p class="text-secondary">Zhu was a born into a desperately poor peasant tenant farmer family in Zhongli Village in the Huai River plain,
            which is in present-day Fengyang, Anhui Province.[3][4] His father was Zhu Shizhen (朱世珍, original name Zhu Wusi
            朱五四) and his mother was Chen Erniang. He had seven older siblings, several of whom were "given away" by his parents,
            as they did not have enough food to support the family.[5] When he was 16, severe drought ruined the harvest
            where his family lived. Subsequently, famine killed his entire family, except one of his brothers. He then buried
            them by wrapping them in white clothes. Destitute, Zhu accepted a suggestion to take up a pledge made by his
            brother and became a novice monk at the Huangjue Temple,[6] a local Buddhist monastery. He did not remain there
            for long, as the monastery ran short of funds, and he was forced to leave. For the next few years, Zhu led the
            life of a wandering beggar and personally experienced and saw the hardships of the common people.[7] After about
            three years, he returned to the monastery and stayed there until he was around 24 years old. He learned to read
            and write during the time he spent with the Buddhist monks.[8]</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rise to power</h4>
          <hr>
          <p class="text-secondary">The monastery where Zhu lived was eventually destroyed by an army that was suppressing a local rebellion. In 1352,
            Zhu joined one of the many insurgent forces that had risen in rebellion against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty.
            He rose rapidly through the ranks and became a commander. His rebel force later joined the Red Turbans, a millenarian
            sect related to the White Lotus Society, and one that followed cultural and religious traditions of Buddhism,
            Zoroastrianism and other religions. Widely seen as a defender of Confucianism and neo-Confucianism among the
            predominant Han Chinese population in China, Zhu emerged as a leader of the rebels that were struggling to overthrow
            the Yuan dynasty. In 1356, Zhu, and his army conquered Nanjing, which became his base of operations, and the
            capital of the Ming dynasty during his reign. Zhu's government in Nanjing became famous for good governance,
            and the city attracted vast numbers of people fleeing from other, more lawless regions.</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reign</h4>
          <hr>
          <p class="text-secondary">Under the Hongwu Emperor's rule, the Mongol, and other foreign bureaucrats, who dominated the government during
            the Yuan dynasty along with Northern Chinese officials, were replaced by Han Chinese officials. The emperor re-instituted,
            then abolished, then restored the Confucian civil service imperial examination system, from which most state
            officials were selected based on their knowledge of literature and philosophy. The Ming examination curriculum
            followed that set by the Yuan in 1313: a focus on the Four Books over the Five Classics, and the commentaries
            of Zhu Xi.[17] The Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, previously marginalised during the Yuan dynasty, were reinstated
            to their predominant roles in the government.</p>
